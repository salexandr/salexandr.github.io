<p>The Kingdom of Poland was formed in 10<sup>th</sup> century and initially ruled
by the Piast dynasty. They had their ups and downs, but generally the history at
that time is not really special. In 1370, however, the last of the dynasty –
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_III_the_Great">Casimir the Great</a> (he
really was a good king: there is a proverb, that he &ldquo;found Poland wooden
and left her masoned&rdquo;, he also funded the first university in the country –
now known as the Jagiellonian University — in 1364,  more than twenty years
before the first was established in Germany) died without a heir. A great king,
he wouldn&rsquo;t leave his country without a monarch, so Casimir had made
arrangements with Louis, the king of Hungary and a close relative, that the
latter would take over, and in return, Hungary agreed to support the
international politics and conquers of the Kingdom of Poland. So far, nothing
spectacular, right? But, the two kings, weren&rsquo;t the only parties in this
agreement. For the first time, the nation had to be consulted&thinsp;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="index.html#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and
promised, that the taxes would be lowered, the king would cover his travelling
expenses, that he would pay during the war duty, and finally — that from then
on, the monarchs in Poland would always need to be approved by the people.</p>

<div class="col-md-3">

    </figcaption>
    
  </figure>
</div>


<p>The last promise was soon to be verified. When it became apparent, that Louis
wouldn&rsquo;t have a son either. He then negotiated with the people again, and they
agreed, that one of his daughters could be the king following his
death&thinsp;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="index.html#fn:2">2</a></sup>. When Louis died and his oldest living daughter was to take
the crown, the nobles denied her, because they wanted more attention for Poland
and didn&rsquo;t think, that it is possible with the king that reigns in Hungary at
the same time. They agreed for the younger daughter –
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadwiga_of_Poland">Jadwiga</a> — to be their king,
and started looking for a good husband for her.</p>

<p>At that time, behind the eastern border of the Kingdom, a small, pagan, and
quite wild Duchy of Lithuania had conquered much more developed, Orthodox
Christian Ruthenia (now Ukraine) and feared, that the more advanced state might
overtake them (Ukrainian was the official language of Lithuania, for example).
Moreover, there was a Teutonic Order attacking Lithuania constantly under the
pretences of Christianisation, which didn&rsquo;t spare Poland either, so we had a
common enemy. All that led to decision, that the Great Duke of Lithuania,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o">Jogalia</a>, should be
baptised (together with his country) in western Christianity, and marry our Lady
King. This seemed like a one-time solution, but the nobles kept agreeing for all
the heirs of Jagiellonian dynasty (named after Jogalia) and the three nations
lived in one huge country quite peacefully for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve seen, that the king in Poland had to be approved by <em>szlachta</em>
(the nobles) and his powers were limited by the promises of his predecessors
(sometimes the nobles could lift some of the limitations, in the parliamentary
gathering called <em>Sejm</em>). In times of Jagiellonian dynasty, the elections were
quite obvious — they just kept electing the heirs — always getting something in
return. Then, in 1572, the last Jagiellonian king — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund_II_Augustus">Zygmunt August</a> — died and no one really
knew what to do. The nobles from all the nations of <em>Rzeczpospolita</em>&thinsp;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="index.html#fn:3">3</a></sup>
agreed that temporarily the Catholic Primate should act as the head of state,
local governments should be in force, and some voluntary military forces were
protecting the borders in case, any of the neighbours wanted to take advantage
of the instability of the country. All that was necessary while they were trying
to find a new king. Once they made sure, the country was safe and running, all
the nobles gathered near Warsaw to settle on requirements for the new monarch.
Then they selected their nominee, the French candidate — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III_of_France">Henri Valois</a> — a brother of Charles IX,
who then was the king of France.</p>

<p>To many the selection was controversial, as <em>Rzeczpospolita</em> was a country of
many religions and the French ruling family&rsquo;s involvement in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew's_Day_massacre">St.
Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day
massacre</a> made
the public opinion rather reluctant to accept the king. For that reason
<em>szlachta</em> decided to set certain conditions, without agreeing to which the
king wouldn&rsquo;t be appointed.</p>

<p>Two documents were formulated: <em>Henrician articles</em> played a role of
constitution, which the king had to acknowledge. It stressed the role of two
houses of Parliament, the limitations of the King (in taxes and policies), the
religious freedoms, it even codified the rightful disobedience called <em>rokosz</em> —
a truly democratic custom coming from Hungary – if the monarch acts against the
privileges of <em>szlachta</em>. The second document — <em>pacta conventa</em> was crafted
especially for each election and contained special expectations the elected king
had to promise to fulfil. In case of Henry, it was expected that he took special
care of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, created Polish Navy on Baltic sea
and paid country&rsquo;s debts with his own money.</p>

<p>The set of these demands was sent with a delegation to France, and it was
expected, that as an example of good will, the French king will cease the
siege of two Huguenot cities (one was La Rochelle), which indeed happened.
They also demanded, that the king wouldn&rsquo;t support any religious
discrimination, neither in Poland nor in his homeland and that France would
introduce religious freedom as well. The situation was very tense, while Henry
tried to avoid making decisions going that far, but he was sharply informed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>nisi id feceris, Rex in Polonia non eris</em><br>
(without signing it you won&rsquo;t be a Polish king)
<footer>Jan Zborowski</footer></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Henri Valois didn&rsquo;t stay in Poland for too long, he returned to France following
the death of his brother and took French throne. What he saw in my country, he
probably viewed as an anarchy (as many historians do). I think however, that the
fact, that every elected king from then on, had to sign a contract with those,
who elected him, was ahead of that times&thinsp;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="index.html#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="let-s-get-back-to-13-sup-th-sup-century">Let&rsquo;s get back to 13<sup>th</sup> century</h3>

<p>In 1264, Poland was fragmented as a consequence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudal_fragmentation">a process</a> that was typical to many
European countries at that time (for some, like Germany, this state was
permanent until mid 19<sup>th</sup> century). There were very many
insignificant duchies fighting with each other for pieces of land. One of the
insignificant dukes — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">Bolesław the Pious</a> — I would probably have never heard about, like I haven&rsquo;t
about all the others, but, for the particular interests of his small duchy he
introduced a law that has changed Polish society to these days.</p>

<p>Around that time, in Western Europe, the tensions risen as an effect of Crusades
and ignited unprecedented violence towards numerous Jewish population in France
and Germany. Polish kings and dukes saw that as an opportunity — they needed
smart people to build economy, especially after Mongol Invasions — and the
smartest communities in the West had to run for their lives. What the latter
only needed was assurance that here they would be safe. Bolesław the Pious was
not the only one to give such an assurance, nor was he the first. The dukes were
very eager to organize Jewish communities in the towns of their lands, so they
introduced a lot of laws to make it happen. The one that Bolesław wrote was
however quite unprecedented in its tolerance. I strongly encourage the reader to
read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Kalisz">the excerpts on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>When the country was finally unified under the rule of Polish king, it didn&rsquo;t
take long for the Statute to be ratified in the whole country. In fact it was
done by the second king after the unification — <em>Casimir the Great</em> (haven&rsquo;t
we heard that name already?). He has even made few more steps. King Casimir
decided, that Jewish quarters in the cities would have their own laws, because
the German laws, that were used for urban areas, were not liberal enough. The
inviting policy of Poland, together with a <a href="http://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death">pandemic of plague</a> for which the Jews were persecuted again
caused entire communities from England, France, Germany and Czechia flee
to our country (and to Hungary).</p>

<p>The freedom of Polish Jews was progressing&thinsp;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="index.html#fn:5">5</a></sup>. It probably reached
its highest during the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_B%C3%A1thory">Stefan
Batory</a> — the best of all our
kings — who was elected after Henri Valois&rsquo; departure. He came from Hungary
(<em>Transylvania</em>) which had similar traditions of freedom, and that made him
much better suited for the throne than the French. He knew well, how to deal
with the nobles and was able to convince the <em>Sejm</em> to impose taxes for the
necessary wars. He also knew, what to answer, when a <em>starosta</em> (senior) of
the city of Lwów declined a lawsuit filled by a Jew:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just like a Jew, is the starosta King&rsquo;s people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under the reign of Batory, <em>Rzeczpospolita</em> (also called “Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth”) was at its best. It reached the greatest area (of around million
square kilometres) later, but at a cost of starting needless wars with everyone
around. Stefan&rsquo;s country however was large enough, with roughly 6.5 million
population, among them 10% were nobles (<em>szlachta</em>), 4% Jews, 20% Burgess, some
clergy, few thousand Ukrainian Cossacks and the remainder of peasants. (only
class that couldn&rsquo;t own or relocate freely, they worked on the fields belonging
to the nobles, and in return needed to work for the owners for two days every
week). It contained nations of Poland, Lithuania and Belarus, Ukraine, Latvia,
Estonia and Prussia (Germans), as well as Jews, Armenians, Tatars (a Muslim
community that lives peacefully in Poland to this days). In central areas
Catholicism was dominant, but the German-speaking regions usually followed
Lutheran faith, in some areas Calvinism was more popular among the nobles, there
were islands of Arians or Bohemian Brethen (Hussites) and large areas (now
Ukraine and Belarus) with dominant Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches. The
economy was based mostly on export of cereal and wood to whole Europe, which was
enough for the country to prosper well at the time. Almost all of the trade took
place in a harbour of Gdańsk, which in turn became a very prosperous and
beautiful city with large autonomy (that also belonged to the Hanseatic League).</p>

<h3 id="where-did-the-greatness-go">Where did the greatness go?</h3>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a fair question. It seems now, three main issues appeared at some
point and weren&rsquo;t addressed properly. Firstly, the location and bad politics
caused too many wars in 17<sup>th</sup> century. Unlike the rest of Europe, we
never suffered through religious wars. Still, the worst invasion called
<em>Swedish Deluge</em> but one third of population were killed and plenty of wealth
was destroyed or stolen (that&rsquo;s why the works of a famous Polish astronomer —
Copernicus — can now be found in Sweden). This sudden drop of economic status of
Polish citizens also stopped them from sending their children to European
universities – which had before been a common practice – and that affected the
society very rapidly. Surviving the wars also led the country to some unpleasant
concessions. In one of them the Polish king allowed for personal union in reign
of Prussia (then part of Rzeczpospolita) and Brandenburg.</p>

<p>After this severe hit, it was harder for the economy to react properly, when in
17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century growing grains became less
prosperous. Instead of modernising the farming technologies or migrating to the
cities (like the West did), the nobles pushed the peasants harder. The economy
was never bad enough to call for new ideas, but was by far not as prosperous as
in the end of 16<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>TThe third factor, in 18<sup>th</sup> century was decision-making. The
Commonwealth, with its democratic system, was surrounded by absolute monarchies.
A common pattern is, that a democratic society is much more peaceful then an
autocratic regime. Our neighbours had employed many lobbyists and loads of money
to disable the country from reforming and defending itself (much alike Soviet efforts to
promote pacifism in the West during the cold war). The 18<sup>th</sup> century
was a time of growing power of Prussia, Russia and Austria. At that time, Polish
elected kings were either completely tied in reform by the democratic
mechanisms, or openly supporting one of the neighbours. The last king —
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_August_Poniatowski">Stanisław August
Poniatowski</a> was
elected in sight of Russian army and backing of German-born Tsar Catherine (who
happened to be his lover). His reign is still very controversial: Poniatowski&rsquo;s
times mark a very vivid political life in Poland, when unimaginable volumes of
press were printed and many modern institutions were created, including secular
system of education (replacing Jesuit schools) or modern army. Many of the
reforms, like a constitution of 3rd May 1791, the first such document in Europe
were passed rather despite than thanks to the King&rsquo;s efforts. Soon after the
constitution had given a light of hope that the country could survive, the
three surrounding empires split it among themselves, starting a 123-years-long
sad period of partitions.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-anything-left">Is there anything left?</h3>

<p>It would be unfair to compare the current size of Poland or Lithuania to the
area of 16th century Rzeczpospolita. Being big wasn&rsquo;t the greatest cultural
achievement of our history. What definitely is still with us (at least many of
us) is a great lot of sympathy to other nations of the Commonwealth. We have our
issues — when nationalisms were rising in 19<sup>th</sup> century, for some
nations it was (and still is) hard to deal with the common history. Many
Lithuanians view Rzeczpospolita as a means of Polish cultural and political
domination, but at the same time they take pride in many of its aspects. For
modern Europeans, usually carrying a simple idea of a nation created in Germany,
it is hard to understand, that the most important Polish poet and writer, Adam
Mickiewicz, started his most important book (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Tadeusz">Pan
Tadeusz</a>, written in Paris in 1834)
with the words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>«Litwo! Ojczyzno moja! ty jesteś jak zdrowie<br>
Ile cię trzeba cenić, ten tylko się dowie,<br>
Kto cię stracił…»<br>
Lithuania, my fatherland! You are like health;<br>
How much you must be valued, will only discover<br>
The one who has lost you.</p>

<footer>Adam Mickiewicz</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>How could he feel a Polish and Lithuanian patriot at the same time? For
Mickiewicz, coming from Lithuania was just a special way of being a Polish
citizen.</p>

<p>The creation of modern Ukrainian nationalism also ignited a debate on a Polish
role in it, a discussion which is still alive. On one hand, there are some bad
memories: the cities in western Ukraine were mainly populated by Poles, while
the countryside was in majority Ukrainian (the nationalities could only be
decided by self-declaration or religion however). After the World War I, the
status of this land was uncertain. It was the intention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski">Józef
Piłsudski</a>, our great leader at
that time, to create a federalist state, where Ukraine and Lithuania would be
members. A solution like this was very natural for him, a Polish patriot born in
Vilnius. He found an ally in Ukraine, the plans were however unfortunately
halted by an outbreak of Polish-Soviet war in which Poland defended itself (and
possibly whole Europe) from yet another barbarian deluge coming from the east,
but great parts of Ukraine were lost to Russia. After Piłsudski&rsquo;s death in 1935,
Polish governments were gradually antagonising Ukrainian population. At the same
time eastern Ukrainians suffered a Stalin&rsquo;s attempt to exterminate a whole
nation through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor">famine</a>. The growing
tensions in Polish-controlled western Ukraine resulted in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia">Volhynian
slaughter</a>
of around 90,000 Polish civilians in 1943 by the Ukrainian partisans, when the
area was occupied by Nazi Germany. For many people in Poland, this is a defining
moment in our long history.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Piłsudski wasn&rsquo;t alone in his idea of building a federation.
He has formed an idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermarium">Intermarium</a> —
a strong coalition of eastern European countries, who share a lot of common
interests and need to address the same threats. This idea is still seriously
considered by intellectuals over the years, and pursued by our current
government&thinsp;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:7"><a rel="footnote" href="index.html#fn:7">6</a></sup>. It does not limit to politicians — there is a great trend
towards friendship between the nations now, when Ukraine is again defending its
territory from Russia. An immigration of over a million Ukrainians is also
building on good relations. When the new Ukrainian president was speaking in our
Sejm in December 2014, he referred to our common roots, similar cultures, spoke
in our language (which is fairly similar to his own) and ended his great, wise
speech with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>«Слава Речі Посполитій і Польському народові! Слава нашій міцній дружбі!
Слава Україні!»
Glory to Rzeczpospolita and the Polish nation! Glory to our constant
friendship! Glory to Ukraine!)</p>

<footer>Petro Poroshenko</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Because when we are in danger&thinsp;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:8"><a rel="footnote" href="index.html#fn:8">7</a></sup>, we realise, that our region can only

<li id="fn:1"><p>To be fair, when we talk about the nation or citizens, we usually mean
  a limited part of the society at that time.</p>

<p>The nobles (<em>szlachta</em>) formed a free class in Poland. What is really
  unique about szlachta, is that they were very numerous (above 10% of total
  population, and there were also priests, Jews, people living in towns, and
  Ukrainian Cossacks who had full personal freedom) and all were equal under
  law, even though there were big economic diversities.</p>
