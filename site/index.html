            <a href="http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/">University of Wrocław</a>,
            from which I had graduated with M.Sc degree in Computer Science.
            In 2010-2018 I lived in Wаrsaw, Poland, where I was working at
            Google (in Search). In Autumn 2014 I worked as a
            <em>“guest scientist”</em> at INET lab,
            <a href="http://www.tu-berlin.de/">Technische Universität Berlin</a>.
            My main interest are testing and translations and I'd
            like to be good at them.

            <p>I have not been programming too much in my life, but there are some interesting projects I've (co-)developed.
            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
              <dt><a href="https://scirank.herokuapp.com/">SciRank</a></dt>
              <dd>This project aims to measure the impact of Polish computer scientists. As the popular measures like <em>number of citations</em> or <em>h-index</em> are easily fooled, we instead decided to quantify the reception of their work in the World's top 20 research centers. The measure is applicable for single papers, people as well as whole institutions.</dd>

              <dt><a href="https://elevate-o-meter.herokuapp.com/">Elevate-o-Meter</a></dt>
              <dd>This is a project for mountain hikers who want to measure the altitude gain of their trips. It is based on an insight, that an intelligent human with a map is more accurate than a GPS recording app.</dd>

              <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/macfox3/">macfox3</a></dt>
              <dd>Well, it is just a Firefox theme that makes the browser look more Apple–like. I ceased maintaining it in 2014, when Mozilla introduced <em>Australis</em>. The developers of Firefox have a habit of changing stuff a lot and it is hard to catch up generally. In total it has been downloaded around 73500 times and roughly 1000 people still have it installed on thier computers.</dd>

              <dt><a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasiekmarc/comprfind">comprfind</a></dt>
              <dd>A Go <ins>(golang)</ins> library for finding patterns in LZW–compressed text without decompressing. Based on a basic <em>&Omicron;</em>(<var>m</var><sup>3</sup>+<var>n</var>) algorithm of Amir, Benson and Farach (1993). It works faster than unpacking–and–searching.</dd>

              <dt><a href="https://zapisy.ii.uni.wroc.pl/">zapisy</a></dt>
              <dd>Our institute's courses enrollment system. For a semester I was involved in maintaining it. While far from being happy about the results (and the general state of the system), I have learned a lot about social aspects of programming, or even working together as a whole.</dd>
